This professional development activity is a Researcher-Led Initiative that is funded by the University of Exeter Researcher Development & Research Culture Team

RDF: D (Engagement, Influence and Impact)

About this course:

Evidence based policy making is needed more than ever, yet there is a dislocation between university research and policy.

The workshop will introduce the science-policy interface and explore ways of engaging with the policy world. It will help PhD students understand why research for policy making is important and how it can be achieved throughout their careers.

Through a series of case studies and panel discussions with external experts and leading academics, the following questions will be addressed:

What is policy making?
How do researchers contribute to policy making?
How is researcher-policy interaction actually done?
What do policy makers require from researchers?
Learning Outcomes:

As a result of attending this course you will be able to:

Have a general understanding of the how, what and why of the science-policy interface
Identify policy relevance in your current research
Design future research with policy impact in mind
Apply new tools and skills for communicating research
Who should attend this course:

PhD students (any year). This workshop is targeted at science/social-science researchers keen to engage with policy making throughout their careers.
